A Scheduling api with a web ui in order to help gaming league organizers schedule matches. And pull that information into other applications like discord or their own website

The project's purpose is to be an easy means for league organizers, teams, and players to set up tables, trees and brackets.

Most of the leagues  all use discord as the main ui for there scheduling. This can be really tedious and hard to manage via discord.

API being built in Python
Web app being built in Node.js for the hope that I can eventually convert it into a desktop app with electron.
